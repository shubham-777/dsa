# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository provides implementations of essential data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science.

## Overview

- **LinkedList**: A singly linked list implementation.

Each implementation includes detailed explanations and examples showcasing how to use them effectively.

## Usage

To use any of the implementations:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubham-777/dsa.git
   cd dsa
   ```
    
2.  Navigate to the specific directory containing the data structure or algorithm of interest.
    
3.  Follow the instructions provided in the README or directly import the module or class into your code.
